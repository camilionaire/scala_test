Notes:

Status: 
At this moment, the Hello2 and Qsort programs all appear to be working.
The quicksort calls bubble sort for array size under 10, the non-
recursive quicksort does not though, as per instructions.  Everything is
commented and the sources are listed where I looked at some algoriths / 
scala nomenclature.

Scala Learning Experience:
The set up was really hard for me.  As it stands, I'm writing and compiling
with Scala3 and then pushing it up to git, pulling it onto the psu server and
making sure it compiles with Scala2 and Java8 from there.  I spent many hours
and failed getting Scala2/Java8 to compile on VSCode on my home machine/laptop.
The actual scala programming has been delightful.  It reminds me a lot of
Haskel but easier learning curve.  I wish I had more time to learn the ins and
outs.  Really want to start using some of the built in calls for map and 
filter and the weird binary return types.
